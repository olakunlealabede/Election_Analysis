# Election_Analysis
## Overview
In this project, our final Python script will need to be able to deliver the following information when the script is run: 

- Total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- Total number of votes each candidate received
- Percentage of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote
# Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.10.2
# Summary
The analysis of the election shows that:

There were 369,711 votes cast in this election.

The candidates were:

1. Charles Casper Stockham
2. Diana DeGette
3. Raymon Anthony Doane

The counties where votes were cast:

1. Jefferson
2. Denver
3. Arapahoe

The candidate results were:

- Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the votes and 85,213 number of votes.
- Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the votes and 272,892 number of votes.
- Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the votes and 11,606 number of votes.

The total votes that were cast in each county:

The winner of the election was Diana DeGette who received 73.8% of the votes and 272,892 number of votes.

# Challenge Overview
The script was written with caution considering all parameters set for the county using provided csv file. This script can be used determined the outcomes of any election when all parameters are duly engaged.

# Challenge Summary
 This python script was able to compute the total number of votes cast, complete the list of candidates who received votes, calculate the total number of votes each candidate received, estimate the percentage of votes each candidate won, and finally select the winner of the election based on popular vote.
